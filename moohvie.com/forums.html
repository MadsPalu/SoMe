            <p class="textreview">Many of us, however, probably experienced a series of misfortunes at least once in our
                lives.
                When something bad happens, you think, “Alright, that should be it.
                Nothing worse can happen to me now”–and then it happens.
                But I guess few people have had a day (or night) as bad as Connie Nikas,
                the main character of an American criminal drama called “Good Time.” Really, just how unfortunate can a
                man be?
                <br>
                <br>
                Filmed in 2017 by Josh and Benny Safdie, the movie is their debut.
                Starring Robert Pattinson as Connie, the film reveals him not only as a brilliant actor,
                but also redeems him of his role in the “Twilight” saga. In other words, Connie looks totally different
                from
                what you would have expected of Pattinson, considering his previous characters.
                I will get to this aspect later; for now, let me briefly review the movie’s plot.
                So, spoilers ahead—consider yourself warned.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s go.
